## Overview of the statistical analysis:

To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, we perform an independent study of Citi Bike Sharing business in New York. We uncover a number of key findings on: 

* how many bike trips were recorded during the month of August? 
* the number of short-term customers and annual subscribers to the Citi Bike service. 
* the peak hours for bike trips 
* what are the highest-traffic locations 
* bike maintenance as one of the biggest expected expenses 
etc

## Methodology:

For this project, we used data from the Citi Bike program in New York City that has been released to the public for our analysis. Since August is a beautiful time of the year to rent a bike, we used August data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.

## Results:
### Number of Rides
August is a beautiful time of the year to rent a bike, we used August data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.
that shows the number of trips recorded during our time period. We have simply display the number of recorded rides.

### August Peak Hours
Since August can be a good month to visit New York City, next we figured out the peak hours for bike trips during the month of August. This will help our investors get a ballpark estimate of how many bikes we might need in Des Moines.

### Checkout Times for Users
In this visualization, we`ve graphed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. This will help us get a better idea of how many bikes we might need in Des Moines.

### Checkout Times By Gender
Often, the first place we start when understanding a population is gender. We now want to know the gender breakdown of Citi Bike riders to help us learn a little more about the customers.In this visualization, we have graphed the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender.

### Trips By Weekday Per Hour
In this visualization, we`ve graphed the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. This will help identifying what days and hours to expect more riders.

### Trips By Gender(Weekday Per Hour)
In this visualization, again we have graphed the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. This will give the gender breakdown of Citi Bike riders to help us learn a little more about the customers.

### User Trips By Gender By Weeday
In this visualization, we have created a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype.

## Summary:
After all critical thinking and data visualization it wont be wrong to say that starting a bikesharing business in Des Moines can be very successful and profitable.
For future analysis I would like to suggest couple more visualization.

### Customer Type
Another piece of data to look into is the number of short-term customers and annual subscribers to the Citi Bike service. This will help us determine the types of customers we could expect for a bike-sharing company in Des Moines. Specifically, we want to find out how the proportion of short-term customers to annual subscribers has changed.
In this case, we can see how many rides were recorded for each type of customer. We now know the breakdown of rider types in New York City, which will help us predict the customer breakdown in Des Moines and, in turn, propose a business model to investors.

### Bike Repair
To put together a strong presentation for the investors, its important to find out what might the key costs be in a bike-share business? We can mull over this question until inspiration strikes: beyond the initial setup, bike maintenance will likely be one of the biggest expenses. A likely concern of investors is the cost of bike upkeep. The bikes used most frequently will probably be the ones that require the most maintenance, so we'll need to determine which bikes have the highest sum of "Number of Rides". We can create a treemap to get an idea of how often each bike is used, and then note which ones are used most frequently.
